This repository contains a business intelligence report analyzing e-commerce sales data. The report provides insights into key performance indicators (KPIs), market trends, customer behavior, and product performance. It aims to demonstrate data analysis and visualization skills using a business intelligence tool (likely Power BI based on the screenshots).
